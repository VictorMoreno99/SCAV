Hi,
In this seminar what i first did is to cut the original BBB video in a 10seconds fragment.
Then I asked the user to give a new scale to resize the video i.e. 720,360,...
With this new scale I resized the fragment and then reconverted the resized fragment to all 4 codecs.
Once i had the 4 codecs i made a montage of the 4 resultant videos to compare them.
In top left we have the av1 video.
In down left we have the vp8 video.
In top right we have the vp9 video.
In down right we have the h265 video.
To compare them right we used the best quality because in 160 the quality is so poor we can not see a difference.
So in 1280x720 we can see that vp8 has the worst quality and av1 has the best quality. This comes with a lot of computational cost
because even though av1 has the best quality and frame rate it is also the one who takes longer to produce. So the other options as
vp9 or h256 are pretty good because they preserve a pretty good quality and take less time and resources to compute.
Note that in vp9 it changes a little bit the colouring.
Then  in the streaming section, i didn't find how to execute it all from my virtual environment so what I found is a way to execute
the streaming as a host from the virtual environment and then from another terminal visualizing the streaming with the code line:
ffplay udp://127.0.0.1:1234
Check that the last part is just the ip and the host and can be variable but we need to use the same ones as the host.
